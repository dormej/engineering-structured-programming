# Structured Programming - Engineering Studies

This repository contains a collection of programming exercises from the "Structured Programming" course, which is part of my engineering degree program.
The exercises focus on various concepts of C programming, including arrays, pointers, structures, memory management, and more.

## Exercises

The repository includes the following examples:

1. **Function Implementations**: Various examples of functions working with arrays, pointers, and other structures.
2. **Array Manipulation**: Code that shows how to manipulate and process arrays.
3. **Structures**: Examples of C structures being used to model data.
4. **Pointers**: Demonstrations of how pointers work in C, including pointer manipulation and memory management.
5. **Matrix Operations**: Codes that perform matrix operations, such as summing elements, calculating averages, and matrix multiplication.
6. **Prime Number Calculations**: Programs to check whether a number is prime and to find the largest prime number below a given number.
7. **Linked Lists**: A linked list program demonstrating the creation and deletion of list elements.
8. **String Manipulation**: Programs that work with strings, performing tasks like trimming, counting digits, etc.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dormej/engineering-structural-programming.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd structural-programming
    ```
3. Open any `.c` file in your preferred text editor and compile it using a C compiler:
    ```bash
    gcc filename.c -o filename
    ./filename
    ```
